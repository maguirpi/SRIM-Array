# SRIM-Array
SRIM maps the interaction of high energy ions impacting on materials at a single point. This code will allow the creation of an array of SRIM data across several points. A more realistic view of real-world ion microscopes for instance.

#Outline of Desired Final Code
1. Read collisons.txt as output from SRIM
2. Collect X,Y,Z values (perhaps later also energy values)
3. Output to xlsx
4. Either use X,Y,Z values as is or read from xlsx to create an array of SRIM data so that the shape of the ion collisions map accounts for overlap of probes 
5. Output Y,Z to a text file in a 2 columned matrix e.g.
Y,Z
Y,Z etc.
6. Can now be opened in origin for plotting
